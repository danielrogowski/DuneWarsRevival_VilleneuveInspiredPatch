And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

The Great Revolt took away a crutch, It forced human minds to develop. Schools were started to train human talents. We have two chief survivors of those ancient schools: the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild. The Guild, so we think, emphasizes almost pure mathematics. Bene Gesserit performs another function.

The thing the ecologically illiterate don't realize about an ecosystem is that it's a system. A system! A system maintains a certain fluid stability that can be destroyed by a misstep in just one niche. A system has order, a flowing from point to point. If something dams the flow, order collapses. The untrained miss the collapse until too late. That's why the highest function of ecology is the understanding of consequences.

In this age when the means of human transport include devices which can span the deeps of space in transtime, and other devices which can carry men swiftly over virtually impassable planetary surfaces, it seems odd to think of attempting long journeys afoot. yet this remains a primary means of travel on Arrakis, a fact attributed partly to preference and partly to the brutal treatment which this planet reserves for anything mechanical. In the strictures of Arrakis, human flesh remains the most durable and reliable resource for the Hajj. Perhaps it is the implicit awareness of this fact which makes Arrakis the ultimate mirror of the soul.

"A cette époque où certains moyens de transport conçus par les hommes peuvent atteindre les profondeurs de l'espace instantanément, et d'autres transporter aisément des hommes à travers toutes les de la planète, mais celles réputées infranchissables, il peut paraître surprenant de continuer à mener de long voyages à pied. La marche reste le principal moyen de déplacement sur Arrakis. Par préférence, mais également en raison du traitement impitoyable que la Planète fait subir à tout ce qui est mécanique. Dans les contrées désolées d'Arrakis, la chair humaine reste la ressource la plus durable et fiable pour le Hajj. Peut-être que c'est la conscience implicite de ce fait qui fait d'Arrakis le miroir ultime de l'âme. "

The nobility of the Imperium have ruled for millenia. Each Noble House rules one or more planets and has a seat in the Landsraad Assembly. Then there are the minor noble Houses, with more limited spheres of influence and power, owing allegiance to their more powerful patrons. Then there are various merchant guilds and other organisations who operate in various ways, sometimes across entire sectors of space, and sometimes just locally on one planet. And then, of course, there are the common people, the subjects in their trillions. They live their lives paying their taxes and wondering if those lofty powers who rule them are even aware of their concerns and tribulations. This is the way it has been and this is the way it will always be.

Faufreluches is a term commonly used to describe the class system of the Imperium. The faufreluche system provides some sort of order for the way in which humanity relates with one another, both to maintain order and civility, and to keep certain groups under control within the Imperium. However, it attempts to minimise alienation of individuals or minorities by catering for everyone. The catchphrase of the faufreluche system is "A place for every man and every man in his place."

The faufreluche system provides some sort of order for the way in which humanity relates with one another, both to maintain order and civility, and to keep certain groups under control within the Imperium. However, it attempts to minimise alienation of individuals or minorities by catering for everyone. The catchphrase of the faufreluche system is "A place for every man and every man in his place."

The nobility of the Imperium have ruled for millenia. Each Noble House rules one or more planets and has a seat in the Landsraad Assembly. Then there are the minor noble Houses, with more limited spheres of influence and power, owing allegiance to their more powerful patrons. Then there are various merchant guilds and other organisations who operate in various ways, sometimes across entire sectors of space, and sometimes just locally on one planet. And then, of course, there are the common people, the subjects in their trillions. They live their lives paying their taxes and wondering if those lofty powers who rule them are even aware of their concerns and tribulations. This is the way it has been and this is the way it will always be.

There was this drylander who was asked which was more important, a literjon of water or a vast pool of water? The drylander thought a moment and then said: "The literjon is more important. No single person could own a great pool of water. But a literjon you could hide under your cloak and run away with it. No one would know.

On demanda à un Nomade ce qui était le plus important entre une outre d'eau et un vaste étang d'eau ? Après un moment, le Nomade dit : "L'outre est plus importante : Personne ne peut posséder une grande étendue d'eau. Par contre, vous pouvez dissimuler l'outre sous votre cape et disparaître avec, sans que personne ne s'en rende compte.

In ages long past, the Zensunni were followers of the teachings of Maometh, the "Third Muhammed". But we broke away to form a new sect, seeking a new path to enlightenment. Yes, we sought to return to the ways of our fathers. We again remembered the truth of Buddallah, the One, whose word has always been rendered to us by the prophets. Ali Ben Ohashi was our first leader; his light was incandescant amongst the stars.

We wandered throughout the galaxy from our first home on Poritrin, finding many new homes but never peace. For peace lies within the self. Salusa Secundis, Bela Tegeuse, Harmonthep, Arrakis, all these worlds were part of our journeys. But the real journey lies inside.

May Buddallah guide you in your journey to peace.

Flying has been a dream of man since he saw the birds float seamlessly in on the winds. Since man has reached and conquered the stars, there is nothing else now. However, not all worlds have benefitted from these advancements. As soon as Arakis was discovered by Imperial Topographers, the planet was quickly fitted with several landing zones for interstellar commerce. The focus on air superiority can be a lucrative thing, since flying is safer than walking out into the open desert.

Beyond a critical point within a finite space, freedom diminishes as numbers increase. This is as true of humans in the finite space of a planetary ecosystem as it is of gas molecules in a sealed flask. The human question is not how many can possibly survive within the system, but what kind of existence is possible for those who do survive.

We must do a thing on Arrakis never before attempted for an entire planet. We must use man as a constructive ecological force -- inserting adapted terraform life: a plant here, an animal there, a man in that place -- to transform the water cycle, to build a new kind of landscape.

House Atreides pioneered the use of the Ornithopter in the Arakian conflict, giving them an initial edge over the other houses. Even though the desert winds are somewhat of a concern, an experienced pilot can avoid them with enough experience. Aerial warfare quickly becomes invaluable in the Arakian conflict, harvesters being a main target for clever commanders who want to disrupt the enemys economy.

Technology, in common with many other activities, tends toward avoidance of risks by investors. Uncertainty is ruled out if possible. Capital investment follows this rule, since people generally prefer the predictable. Few recognize how destructive this can be, how it imposes severe limits on variability and thus makes whole populations fatally vulnerable to the shocking ways our universe can throw the dice.

"La Technologie, ainsi que beaucoup d'autres activités, tend à éviter les risques pour les investisseurs. in common with many other activities, tends toward avoidance of risks by investors. L'incertitude est exclue si c'est possible. Les investissements en capital suivent cette règle, puisque les gens préfèrent généralement un avenir prévisible. Peu reconnaissent à quel point c'est destructif, comme cette règle impose des limites de variabilité, entraînant des populations entières, fatalement vulnérables aux chemins tortueux que notre univers nous réserve."

Arrakis... Dune... desert planet. There is not one drop of free standing water on this planet. It is a harsh place that teaches harsh rules if you want to survive it. The Fremen have learnt these rules very well. They do not understand comfort and luxury. It is this that has made them strong. To prosper on this planet the skills of desert survival are essential.

"Each bush, each weed you see out there in the erg, how do you suppose it lives when we leave it? Each is planted most tenderly in its own little pit. The pits are filled with smooth ovals of chromoplastic. Light turns them white. You can see them glistening in the dawn if you look down from a high place. White reflects. But when Old Father Sun departs, the chromoplastic reverts to transparency in the dark. It cools with extreme rapidity. The surface condenses moisture out of the air. That moisture trickles down to keep our plants alive."

Ornithopter: The basic method of airborne travel in the Imperium. The common ornithopter was a very late development in the history of atmospheric flight. 
The first ornithopters, that is, vehicles that fly like birds rather than powered gliders or helicopters, were built by a team of scientists being held as political prisoners (as a result of the abortive Thinkers' Rebellion of 7600 B.G.) by Emperor Neweh in 7585 B.G. 
Their head was Jehane Golitle, who was placed in charge of an understaffed, underfunded, and discouraged team of scientists, and told to earn her team's continued well-being by inventing useful devices which would make a profit for the emperor.

The Spacing Guild has a monopoly on imperial banking and interstellar travel: with the use of melange, the geriatric spice, Guild Navigators are the only beings capable of piloting the massive Guild heighliners safely through space. The heightened awareness and prescience the spice grants allows the Navigator to plot a safe course between the stars. Contrary to popular belief, the navigators do not themselves 'fold' space, allowing a nearly instantaneous trip. The space-folding is accomplished by Holtzman engines activated from the navigator's chamber.

The Guild is apolitical (with exceptions), since their monopoly allows them to dictate terms to all parties that preserves the economy that supports them. As the only party able to transport goods in an interstellar economy, the Guild's highest concern is that commerce continue; for commerce to continue, the Guild must continue; for the Guild to continue, melange must be available. Ultimately, the Guild's only concern is that melange continue to be mined on Arrakis. Because spice is a requirement for long distance space transport, their motto resonates throughout the empire: "the spice must flow."

Even though the concept of the ablative heat shield was described as early as 1920 by Robert Goddard, its usefulness is enough to make it a viable means of defending armor battalions and ships. This is type of heat shield best protects against high heat flux. The ablative heat shield functions by lifting the hot shock layer gas away from the heat shield's outer wall (creating a cooler boundary layer) through blowing. Ablation can also provide blockage against radiative heat flux by introducing carbon into the shock layer thus making it optically opaque.

Since its inception, the taking of the Water of Life could only be conducted by women appropriately trained in prana/bindu. Any man, who had tried, had died. Bene Gesserit plans had it that the culmination of their breeding program would result in a male Bene Gesserit who could successfully convert the Water of Life. This man would be the Kwisatz Haderach. In 10193 AG, Paul Atreides was the first male to succeed in converting the the Water of Life, in a process that kindled new and immense powers in the young Atreides Duke. Before, and even after this attempt, many men had attempted the process and died. Paul had consumed only one drop of the bile, and it had put him into such a deep coma that he was believed dead. After three weeks, however, he emerged, having successfully converted the bile into the Water of Life. Along with it came many powerful abilities, such as perfect prescience. With that prescience, Paul saw the future of Humanity, a future that terrified him.

Since its inception, the taking of the Water of Life could only be conducted by women appropriately trained in prana/bindu. Any man, who had tried, had died. Bene Gesserit plans had it that the culmination of their breeding program would result in a male Bene Gesserit who could successfully convert the Water of Life. This man would be the Kwisatz Haderach. In 10193 AG, Paul Atreides was the first male to succeed in converting the the Water of Life, in a process that kindled new and immense powers in the young Atreides Duke. Before, and even after this attempt, many men had attempted the process and died. Paul had consumed only one drop of the bile, and it had put him into such a deep coma that he was believed dead. After three weeks, however, he emerged, having successfully converted the bile into the Water of Life. Along with it came many powerful abilities, such as perfect prescience. With that prescience, Paul saw the future of Humanity, a future that terrified him.

Due to the monopoly of the spice, finding a viable alternative gradually became the focus of certain groups - most notably the Tleilaxu. Control of the spice during the Corrino Empire was later eclipsed in scope by the God-Emperor Leto Atreides II. This led to protracted attempts to synthesize the spice, which eventually yielded positive results for the Bene Tleilax, some 1500 years after Leto II's death. As a result, the Tleilaxu became spice merchants and funded many of their endeavours through sales revenue.

Either we abandon the long-horned Theory of Relativity, or we cease to believe that we can engage in continued accurate prediction of the future. Indeed, knowing the future raises a host of questions which cannot be answered under conventional assumptions unless one first projects an Observer outside of Time and, second, nullifies all movement. If you accept the Theory of Relativity, it can be shown that Time and the Observer must stand still in relationship to each or inaccuracies will intervene. This would seem to say that it is impossible to engage in accurate prediction of the future. How, then, do we explain the continued seeking after this visionary goal by respected scientists? How, then do we explain Muad'Dib?
